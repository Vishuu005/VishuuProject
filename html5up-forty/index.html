										<h3><a href="landing.html" class="link">ANGULAR</a></h3>
										<p>Angular is a platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript. Angular is written in TypeScript. It implements core and optional functionality as a set of TypeScript libraries that you import into your applications.
										The architecture of an Angular application relies on certain fundamental concepts. The basic building blocks of the Angular framework are Angular components that are organized into NgModules. NgModules collect related code into functional sets; an Angular application is defined by a set of NgModules.</p>

										<h3><a href="landing.html" class="link">Advance Java</a></h3>
										<p>Java is divided into two parts i.e. Core Java (J2SE) and Advanced Java (JEE). 
											The core Java part covers the fundamentals (data types, functions, operators, loops, 
											thread, exception handling, etc.) of the Java programming language. It is used to develop
											 general purpose applications. Whereas Advanced Java covers the standard concepts
											  such as database connectivity, networking, Servlet, web-services, etc. In this section, 
											  we will discuss what is advance Java, its benefit, uses, 
											topics of advance Java, and the difference between core Java and advance Java.
											It is a part of Java programming language. It is an advanced technology or 
											advance version of Java specially designed to develop web-based, network-centric 
											or enterprise applications. 
											It includes the concepts like Servlet, JSP, JDBC, RMI, Socket programming, etc.

										<h3><a href="landing.html" class="link">JAVA</a></h3>
										<p>Java is a general-purpose, class-based, object-oriented programming 
											language designed for having lesser implementation dependencies. 
											It is a computing platform for application development. Java is fast, secure, and reliable, 
											therefore. It is widely used for developing Java applications in laptops, 
											data centers, game consoles, scientific supercomputers, cell phones, etc.
											Java Platform is a collection of programs that help 
											programmers to develop and run Java programming applications efficiently. 
											It includes an execution engine, a compiler, and a set of libraries in it. 
											It is a set of computer software and specifications. James Gosling 
											developed the Java platform at Sun Microsystems, and the Oracle Corporation later acquired it.

										<h3><a href="landing.html" class="link">BacktoBack Coding</a></h3>
										<p>Coding is a list of step-by-step instructions that get computers to do what you want them to do. Coding makes it possible for us to create computer software, games, apps and websites.
											Coders, or programmers, are people who write the programmes behind everything we see and do on a computer. When children learn to code, it helps them to develop essential skills such as problem solving, logic and critical thinking. Through coding, children can learn that there’s often more than one way to solve a problem, and that simpler and more efficient solutions are often better. 
											Learning to code encourages children to become creators, not just consumers, of the technology they use.</p>

										<h2>About Programmers Life</h2>
									</header>
									<p>The Life of a Programmer: The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly
										This article will cover the life of a programmer. We’ll talk about what it takes to become a programmer; the good, the bad, and the ugly.
										A programmer’s day-to-day life is generally spent reading code, fixing errors, and writing new pieces of code. Programming is a highly mentally demanding job as it requires constant problem-solving. In addition to these tasks,
										 there are also meetings with other programmers and stakeholders in the project.
										<br><strong>The Good:</strong>Programmers have a high salary. They work in an industry that is growing rapidly and as an added bonus, 
										they work on some of the most challenging problems in society today.
										<br><strong>The Ugly:</strong>Programmers are faced with long hours, irregular deadlines, and tight deadlines for projects. They’re often exposed to high levels of stress
										 and many other detrimental factors that come with being a computer programmer. 
										 <br><strong>The Bad:</strong>All these negatives can wear down programmers who don’t have enough time to decompress or enjoy their lives outside of work.
